### What is GitHub
GitHub is essentially a FREE online server (you may say like a google drive) particularly for developers.
Developers care share code on GitHub, even HTML.
While the html is on a server, it is basically hosting a website. The our suppop project website is now put into my github account, under the folder suppop.
### Creat you github account
[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
then tell me what your account name is, i need that for sharing the website folder (or say repository, it is just a folder on GitHub).
### How can we collab and edit the website 
It is a bit different from Google Drive that we are not live editing the source code, coz too many people coding the same page causes crashes.
The normal GitHub practice is like this:
1. Pull (download) the existing code from the folder on the server. Now you should have the exact same copy like the one on the server.
..*[https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
GitHub Desktop is an app (client) for uploading code to the server. You will need this, or you will need to type in something troublesome with terminal.
..*clone (download the existing folder) the repository by "file" ==> "clone repository" ==> "URL" ==> paste "https://github.com/jasontsemf/suppop.git" ==> set your local path for putting your project
2. Edit the website (the code) LOCALLY on your device. I recommend [Atom](https://github.com/jasontsemf/suppop.git) for editing
3. Commit (it means adding a new record of upload, confirm you are going to upload something new to the server), when you commit, you should leave some comment, about what you have updated for this commitment.
..* Now you can view the difference (the changes) of the code by looking at the UI, this part can be very tricky, when you try co commit code, make sure your code is not going to overwrite something very important in the original file on the server.
..* While comparing your code and the existing online code, you can select whether replacing the original code with your new code.
4. Sync. It means the actual file uploading, (sometimes downloading, when you code is old and you need the new code from the server) no files is transmitted until you press sync.
5. Go to the website, see is everything doing great.
